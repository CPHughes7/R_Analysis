## Overview

This repository contains R scripts and notebooks showcasing my data analysis skills, specifically applied to COVID-19 and NYPD shooting incident data. Each project is structured as a separate module within the `projects` directory.

## Projects

### 1. COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing global COVID-19 data, exploring trends, and visualizing the impact of the pandemic. Key components include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Visualization of trends over time
- 

### 2. NYPD Shooting Data Analysis

This project delves into the analysis of NYPD shooting incidents, aiming to uncover patterns, demographics, and trends. Key components include:

- Demographic breakdown of shooting victims and perpetrators
- Spatial analysis of shooting incidents
- Time-series analysis to identify temporal patterns
